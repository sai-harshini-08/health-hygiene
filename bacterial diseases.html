<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:50px;">   
    Bacterial diseases are infections caused by harmful bacteria, which are microorganisms that can invade the body, 
    multiply, and cause damage to tissues. While many bacteria are beneficial or harmless, some can cause illness. 
    Bacterial diseases affect various parts of the body and range in severity from mild infections to life-threatening 
    conditions.
Here are some common types of bacterial diseases, categorized by the organ systems they affect</p>
     <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
        <b>1. Respiratory Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Tuberculosis (TB):</b>Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this infection primarily affects the lungs but can
         spread to other parts of the body. 
        <b>Pneumonia:</b>Often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Legionella pneumophila. 
        It leads to inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs.
        <b>Whooping Cough (Pertussis):</b>Caused by Bordetella pertussis, this infection results in severe coughing
         fits and can be dangerous, especially in infants.
        <b>Strep Throat:</b>Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, leading to sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes.
        <b>2. Skin and Soft Tissue Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Cellulitis:</b>Caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus, it results in swollen, red skin that feels hot and tender.
        <b>Impetigo:</b>A highly contagious skin infection, commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus.
        <b>Boils and Abscesses:</b>Often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, these are painful, pus-filled bumps that form under the skin.
        <b>3. Gastrointestinal Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Salmonellosis:</b>Caused by Salmonella species, it typically results in diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.
        <b>Cholera:</b>Caused by Vibrio cholerae, it leads to severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, and can be 
        life-threatening without treatment.
        <b>E. coli Infections:</b>Caused by Escherichia coli, certain strains can cause severe diarrhea, cramps, and vomiting.
        <b>4. Sexually Transmitted Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Gonorrhea:</b>Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it affects the reproductive organs and can cause pain, discharge, 
        and complications like infertility.
        <b>Syphilis:</b>Caused by Treponema pallidum, it progresses through stages, from sores to severe systemic damage if untreated.
        <b>Chlamydia:</b>Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, it often presents with few symptoms but can lead to infertility 
        and other reproductive complications if untreated.
        <b>5. Neurological Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Meningitis:</b>Caused by bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae, 
        it results in inflammation 
        of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
        <b>Tetanus:</b>Caused by Clostridium tetani, this infection leads to muscle stiffness and spasms, often triggered by a wound.
        <b>Botulism:</b>Caused by Clostridium botulinum, this rare but serious illness results in muscle paralysis.
        <b>6. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)</b>
        <b>Cystitis:</b>Often caused by Escherichia coli, this infection affects the bladder and can cause painful urination, urgency, 
        and abdominal discomfort.
        <b>Pyelonephritis:</b>A kidney infection that typically results from the spread of a bladder infection.
        <b>7. Vector-Borne Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Lyme Disease:</b>Caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks, it results in fever, rash, and long-term joint 
        and neurological issues if untreated.
        <b>Plague:</b>Caused by Yersinia pestis, historically known as the "Black Death," transmitted through flea bites and causing 
        severe illness with fever, chills, and swollen lymph nodes (buboes).
        <b>Leptospirosis:</b>Caused by Leptospira species, it is spread through water contaminated by animal urine and can lead to 
        liver and kidney damage.
        <b>8. Foodborne Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Listeriosis:</b>Caused by Listeria monocytogenes, this infection is often contracted by eating contaminated food and can 
        be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
        <b>Campylobacteriosis:</b>Caused by Campylobacter bacteria, it leads to diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, often from 
        consuming undercooked poultry.
        <b>9. Zoonotic Bacterial Infections</b>
        <b>Anthrax:</b>Caused by Bacillus anthracis, humans typically contract it through contact with infected animals or their products.
        <b>Brucellosis:</b>Caused by Brucella species, transmitted from animals to humans through unpasteurized dairy products or 
        direct contact with infected animals.
        <b>Treatment</b>
        <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:10px;">Bacterial infections are typically treated with 
            antibiotics. However, the specific type of antibioticdepends on the bacteria causing the infection. Overuse and misuse of 
            antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making treatment more difficult.
            Preventative measures, such as vaccines (e.g., for tuberculosis or whooping cough) and maintaining proper hygiene 
            (e.g., hand washing, safe food handling), can help reduce the risk of bacterial infections.</p>
